## Techstack

I built it with Vue.js 3.0 framework. For styling I used SCSS pre-processors, site is fully responsive. API which i decided to use is bit.ly API. For unit tests I used JEST framework.

## Problems and what I have learned

Doing this project I used JEST framework for unit tests first time. I was also practising Vue.js concepts, especially transitions and animations. Also had a lot of trouble with deployment app to Netlify. I didn't know how env variables work but spent some time learning how they work
